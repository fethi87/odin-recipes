    <h2>Frying Pan</h2>
    <p>
      ‘An Pan’, Sweet Azuki Paste Stuffed Bun, is very popular in Japan. ‘An
      Pan’ is baked in the oven, but you can deep-fry them to make ‘An
      Doughnuts’, which is my favourite. As I have been reluctant to fry
      anything since my kitchen accident when I burnt my face with hot oil,
      today I cooked them in a frying pan with no oil at all. This is the
      easiest and quickest way to cook.

        Combine Bread Flour, Dry Yeast, Sugar and Salt in a large bowl. Make a
        well in the centre and pour in Warm Milk, Egg and Butter. Mix well to
        form a soft dough. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, gradually adding extra
        Flour as required, until smooth and elastic.
