    <h2>Anko (Sweet Red Bean Paste)</h2>
    <p>
      ‘An Pan’, Sweet Azuki Paste Stuffed Bun, is very popular in Japan. ‘An
      Pan’ is baked in the oven, but you can deep-fry them to make ‘An
      Doughnuts’, which is my favourite. As I have been reluctant to fry
      anything since my kitchen accident when I burnt my face with hot oil,
      today I cooked them in a frying pan with no oil at all. This is the
      easiest and quickest way to cook.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 & 3/4 cups Bread Flour *and extra for kneading</li>
      <li>1 to 2 teaspoons Dry Yeast *1 teaspoon takes longer time to proof</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Caster Sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Warm Milk</li>
      <li>1 Egg *lightly whisked</li>
      <li>20g Butter *melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine Bread Flour, Dry Yeast, Sugar and Salt in a large bowl. Make a
        well in the centre and pour in Warm Milk, Egg and Butter. Mix well to
        form a soft dough. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, gradually adding extra
        Flour as required, until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with a plate or plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for
        1-2 hours or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll Tsubu-an (Sweet Azuki Paste) into 8 balls. About 2 tablespoonfuls
        (30g) for each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 8 portions. Flatten each portion of dough to about
        10cm round. Place one ball of Tsubu-an in centre, draw the edges up to
        form a bun, pinch the edges very well, then flatten to 2cm thick. Make 8
        Buns and place on a lightly floured surface with sealed side down. Set
        aside for 30 to 60 minutes to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large nonstick frying pan or thick-base skillet over medium heat,
        then lower the heat to very low. Carefully place the Buns, the number of
        the Buns depends on the size of the frying pan, cover with a lid, and
        cook for 4-5 minutes. Turn over, cover with the lid, and cook for 4-5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining ‘An Pan’.</li>
