    <p>
      Caesar Salad Dressing is popular. You may have a bottle of it in your
      fridge. This is a simple salad of Broccoli dressed with the dressing. I
      recommend to add Nuts such as Almonds to this salad. You can use uncooked
      Broccoli, but I prefer Broccoli slightly cooked, only slightly.
